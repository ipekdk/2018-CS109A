            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  For the last few decades, toxic levels of arsenic (As) in groundwater from the aquifers of the Ganges River delta, India and Bangladesh, have been known to cause serious public health concerns. Innumerable studies have advocated the control of geomorphologic, geologic, hydrogeologic, biogeochemical, and anthropogenic factors on arsenic mobilization, flow, and distribution patterns within the Ganges River delta. We have developed transboundary regional-scale models for computing the probability of groundwater As concentrations to exceed the WHO permissible thresholds for drinking water of 10 μg/L within the Ganges River delta as a function of the various geomorphologic-(hydro)geologic-hydrostratigraphic-anthropogenic controlling factors, using statistical methods and artificial intelligence (AI) [i.e., machine learning] techniques namely, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms, followed by probabilistic delineation the high As-hazard zones within the delta. A “hybrid multi-modeling approach” was adapted for this study, which involved the introduction of hydrostratigraphic parameters (aquifer connectivity and surficial aquitard thickness) derived from a high-resolution transboundary hydrostratigraphic model developed for the Ganges River delta aquifer system, as predictors for modeling groundwater As probabilities within the delta.\n",
            "                  The RF model outperforms the BRT and LR model in terms of model performance. Model outputs suggest the dominant influence of surficial aquitard thickness and groundwater-fed irrigated area (%) on groundwater As. While, the north-central and southern regions of the Ganges River delta show low As-hazard (<10 μg/L), the western and north-eastern regions demonstrate elevated hazard level (>10 μg/L). An estimated 30.3 million people are found to be exposed to elevated groundwater As within the study area. Thus, our study demonstrates that such hybrid, predictive models are not only helpful in delineating the regional-scale distribution of groundwater As-hazard zones in the areas with limited As data but is also useful in identifying the possible exogenous forcing that may have led to the worst, natural pollution in human history.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  As of August 2020, thousands of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) publications have been produced. Manual assessment of their scope is an overwhelming task, and shortcuts through metadata analysis (e.g., keywords) assume that studies are properly tagged. However, machine learning approaches can rapidly survey the actual text of publication abstracts to identify research overlap between COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, research hotspots, and areas warranting exploration. We propose a fast, scalable, and reusable framework to parse novel disease literature. When applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, dimensionality reduction suggests that COVID-19 studies to date are primarily clinical, modeling, or field based, in contrast to the vast quantity of laboratory-driven research for other (non-COVID-19) coronavirus diseases. Furthermore, topic modeling indicates that COVID-19 publications have focused on public health, outbreak reporting, clinical care, and testing for coronaviruses, as opposed to the more limited number focused on basic microbiology, including pathogenesis and transmission.\n",

The objective of this study is to initiate the development of a predictive maintenance solution in the shipping industry based on a computational artificial intelligence model using real-time monitoring data. The data analysed originates from the historical values from sensors measuring the vessel´s engines and compressors health and the software used to analyse these data was R. The results demonstrated key parameters held a stronger influence in the overall state of the components and proved in most cases strong correlations amongst sensor data from the same equipment. The results also showed a great potential to serve as inputs for developing a predictive model, yet further elements including failure modes identification, detection of potential failures and asset criticality are some of the issues required to define prior designing the algorithms and a solution based on artificial intelligence. A systematic approach using big data and machine learning as techniques to create predictive maintenance strategies is already creating disruption within the shipping industry, and maritime organizations need to consider how to implement these new technologies into their business operations and to improve the speed and accuracy in their maintenance decision making.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Air pollution can increase the risk of respiratory diseases, enhancing the susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Some studies suggest that small air particles facilitate the spread of viruses and also of the new coronavirus, besides the direct person-to-person contagion. However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5–10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21–32% additional cases, whose 19–28% more positives and 4–14% more deaths. Our findings, demonstrating that fine-particulate (PM2.5) pollutant level is the most important factor to predict SARS-CoV-2 effects that would worsen even with a slight decrease of air quality, highlight that the imperative of productivity before health and environmental protection is, indeed, a short-term/small-minded resolution.\n",

            "                  The demand for high-quality food products is increasing globally at unprecedented rates in response to growing health concerns and consumer awareness about healthy food options. Yet, the tools for determining food quality remain restricted to well-equipped laboratories, not readily accessible to consumers. Unfortunately, the current inspection mechanisms are limited and cannot keep track of all the products continuously, which exposes weakness in the system towards adulteration, falsification, and mislabeling products. Consumers rely on manufacturer labeling alone, with no convenient and user-friendly tool to confirm quality, especially for organic products. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides an opportunity for these tools to be developed. In this study, we demonstrate that simple sound vibrations traversing the food products can be used in conjunction with deep learning models to verify high quality products with no additives, as well as organic food products. Our neural network models, namely Parallel CNN-RNN and CRNN, achieve high accuracy on the defined classification tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an AI-based tool utilizing simple sound vibrations to identify adulteration in food products.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  DDoS attacks remain one of the top cyber threats targeting the financial, health care, retail, gaming, and political sectors, which affects Internet service disruption, data or monetary loss. Security experts have predicted that the development of 5G technology will increase the frequency and the vector of DDoS attacks. Moreover, enhanced DDoS attack technology utilises artificial intelligence [1], which will escalate the level of difficulty to identify malicious traffic correctly to mitigate the attack effectively. The Internet service provider (ISP) is the connector between the users and the Internet. Deploying DDoS mitigation systems within the ISP domain can offer an efficient solution. Therefore, we propose a dynamic learning system (DLS) for the ISP. The DLS is an unsupervised ensemble model using the Complete Autoencoder (CA) as base learners to classify network traffic. The utmost difference between the CA and the regular Autoencoder is that the CA exploits the imbalanced characteristic of the attack data to generate a binary classification via a class switch. When the predicted number of normal IP addresses is over 50% of the total IP addresses, the CA swaps the class of the IP addresses. The CA is directed by a reference object (RO), which is either a reference limit or the mean of a reference error function ( R L 1 ¯ ), to furnish the automation to the DLS. The DLS was trained with a TCP-ICMP flood attack and tested with a UDP-TCP and a UDP-TCP-ICMP flood attack data set. The average Recall, Precision and F1 Score are all above 0.97. Additionally, the DLS outperformed the K-means and the Self-Organising Map models on a UDP flood attack data set.\n",

It can improve the endothelialization process through electrical stimulation and can enable controlled gene delivery into specific parts of the blood vessel via electroporation. The electronic blood vessel has excellent biocompatibility in the vascular system and shows great patency 3 months post-implantation in a rabbit model. The electronic blood vessel would be an ideal platform to enable diagnostics and treatments in the cardiovascular system and can greatly empower personalized medicine by creating a direct link of the vascular tissue-machine interface.\n",

            "                  Gerontechnology based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to fulfill the promise of the so-called 4p-medicine and enable a predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory elderly care. Although empirical evidence shows positive health outcomes, commentators are concerned that AI-based gerontechnology could bring along the disruption of elderly care. A systematic conceptualization of these concerns is lacking. In this paper, such a conceptualization is suggested by analyzing the risks of AI in elderly care as “4d-risks”: the depersonalization of care through algorithm-based standardization, the discrimination of minority groups through generalization, the dehumanization of the care relationship through automatization, and the disciplination of users through monitoring and surveillance. Based on the 4d-model, strategies for a patient-centered AI in elderly care are outlined. Whether AI-based gerontechnology will actualize the 4p-perspective or bring about the 4d-scenario depends on whether joint efforts of users, caregivers, care providers, engineers, and policy makers will be made.\n",

With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better. AI is an opportunity and a mirror for all disciplines to improve their impact on society and for medicine the stakes could not be higher.\n",

However, the publicity created by tech firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon about Artificial Intelligence and applications to unstructured data is not the end of the field. There abound many applications of deep learning, particularly within the construction sector in areas such as site planning and management, health and safety and construction cost prediction, which are yet to be explored. The overall aim of this article was to review existing studies that have applied deep learning to prevalent construction challenges like structural health monitoring, construction site safety, building occupancy modelling and energy demand prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of deep learning techniques within the construction industry. This review would inspire future research into how best to apply image processing, computer vision, natural language processing techniques of deep learning to numerous challenges in the industry. Limitations of deep learning such as the black box challenge, ethics and GDPR, cybersecurity and cost, that can be expected by construction researchers and practitioners when adopting some of these techniques were also discussed.\n",

Currently, numerous AI applications are in development, with potential benefits spanning all steps of the imaging chain from test ordering to report communication. AI has been proposed as a means to optimize patient scheduling, improve worklist management, enhance image acquisition, and help radiologists interpret diagnostic studies. Although the potential for AI in radiology appears almost endless, the field is still in the early stages, with many uses still theoretical, in development, or limited to single institutions. Moreover, although the current use of AI in radiology has emphasized its clinical applications, some of which are in the distant future, it is increasingly clear that AI algorithms could also be used in the more immediate future for a variety of noninterpretive and quality improvement uses. Such uses include the integration of AI into electronic health record systems to reduce unwarranted variation in radiologists’ follow-up recommendations and to improve other dimensions of radiology report quality. In the end, the potential of AI in radiology must be balanced with acknowledgment of its current limitations regarding generalizability and data privacy.\n",

Driven by the desire to develop a computer-aided system for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to assist radiologists and clinicians to combat with this pandemic, we retrospectively collected 206 patients with positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 and their 416 chest computed tomography (CT) scans with abnormal findings from two hospitals, 412 non-COVID-19 pneumonia and their 412 chest CT scans with clear sign of pneumonia are also retrospectively selected from participating hospitals. Based on these CT scans, we design an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses a multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) and evaluate its performance at both slice level and scan level. Experimental results show that the proposed AI has promising diagnostic performance in the detection of COVID-19 and differentiating it from other common pneumonia under limited number of training data, which has great potential to assist radiologists and physicians in performing a quick diagnosis and mitigate the heavy workload of them especially when the health system is overloaded.

College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Although many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of curated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core, spreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data encapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefficient relative to relational database systems, which gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data fields are “typed” (that is, they contain specific kinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes impossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efficient ways, minimizing space and memory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called SQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data fields on very precise subsets of patients. Databases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efficient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data available in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data. Ultimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artificial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way heretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Background Inpatient falls, many resulting in injury or death, are a serious problem in hospital settings. Existing falls risk assessment tools, such as the Morse Fall Scale, give a risk score based on a set of factors, but don’t necessarily signal which factors are most important for predicting falls. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods provide an opportunity to improve predictive performance while also identifying the most important risk factors associated with hospital-acquired falls. We can glean insight into these risk factors by applying classification tree, bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting methods applied to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Objective The purpose of this study was to use tree-based machine learning methods to determine the most important predictors of inpatient falls, while also validating each via cross-validation. Materials and methods A case-control study was designed using EHR and electronic administrative data collected between January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013 in 14 medical surgical units. The data contained 38 predictor variables which comprised of patient characteristics, admission information, assessment information, clinical data, and organizational characteristics. Classification tree, bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting methods were used to identify the most important factors of inpatient fall-risk through variable importance measures. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve were computed via ten-fold cross validation and compared via pairwise t-tests. These methods were also compared to a univariate logistic regression of the Morse Fall Scale total score. Results In terms of AUROC, bagging (0.89), random forest (0.90), and boosting (0.89) all outperformed the Morse Fall Scale (0.86) and the classification tree (0.85), but no differences were measured between bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting, at a p-value of 0.05. History of Falls, Age, Morse Fall Scale total score, quality of gait, unit type, mental status, and number of high fall risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) were considered the most important features for predicting inpatient fall risk. Conclusions Machine learning methods have the potential to identify the most relevant and novel factors for the detection of hospitalized patients at risk of falling, which would improve the quality of patient care, and to more fully support healthcare provider and organizational leadership decision-making. Nurses would be able to enhance their judgement to caring for patients at risk for falls. Our study may also serve as a reference for the development of AI-based prediction models of other iatrogenic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the importance of patient, clinical, and organizational features based on the use of AI approaches.\n",

These technology tools were originally identified as mechanisms that would make future care easier or better; however, these tech solutions amidst COVID-19 are now viewed as essential. The use of technology discussed in this article has been accelerated during the current crisis because technology can provide distance, safety for health care professionals and patients, faster results reporting, virtual visits, and more. As we move forward, technology will continue to be positioned to best address public health needs and improve care efficiencies, as well as develop treatments and vaccines.

            "                  Nowadays, new highly-developed technologies are changing traditional processes related to medical and healthcare systems. Emerging Mobile Health (M-Health) systems are examples of novel technologies based on advanced data communication, deep learning, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, and other machine learning methods. Data are collected from sensor nodes and forwarded to local databases through new technologies that enable cellular networks and then store the information in cloud storage systems. From cloud computing services or medical centres, the data are collected for further analysis. Furthermore, machine learning techniques are being used for accurate prediction of disease analysis and for purposes of classification. This paper presents a detailed overview of M-Health systems, their model and architecture, technologies and applications and also discusses statistical and machine learning approaches. We also propose a secure Android-based architecture to collect patient data, a reliable cloud-based model for data storage. Finally, a predictive model able to classify cardiovascular diseases according to their seriousness will be discussed. Moreover, the proposed prediction model has been compared with existing models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The experimental results show encouraging results in terms of the proposed predictive model for an M-Health system.

L’évaluation du coût de ces innovations numériques se heurte à de nombreuses difficultés, qui tiennent à la fois aux limites des méthodes classiques d’évaluation médicoéconomiques face aux technologies de santé et aux obstacles spécifiques introduits par le numérique.

            "                  Democratization of sensing devices in industrial systems has made it possible to collect a large amount of data of different types, which has led to the necessity of handling complex analyses for knowledge extraction. The field of water resources is of those areas which has drawn the attention of decision-makers seeking to preserve human health and safety. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the domain of Machine Learning, have opened the potential to leverage massive data to better address the issue related to the relationship between water quality and human activities. However, high rate of missing data and heterogeneity of the measurements are scientific issues that cannot be solved by standard methods, especially when no prior knowledge on the label of each observation is provided. In this article, Prognostics and Health Management was implemented to detect and diagnose anomalies in water quality datasets, taking into account the uncertainties induced by the above-mentioned issues. Fuzzy c-means was used to identify the different water quality classes, while Random Forest was applied to determine the most influencing parameters, with respect to potential contamination of water resources in the southwest of France. The results suggest that multiple imputation methods can handle the missingness issue, while the use of decision rules based on well-known water quality standards can solve the problem regarding the lack of labelled observations. In addition, two potential sources of contamination (atrazine and nitrate) were identified and then validated by hydrogeology experts, prior to further online deployment of the proposed model.\n",

            "                  The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health problem once according to the World Health Organization up to June 24th, 2020, more than 9.1 million people were infected, and more than 470 thousand have died worldwide. In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The models’ effectiveness are evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD–single models achieved better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.\n",

            "                  Anthrax is one of the important diseases in humans and animals, caused by the gram-positive bacteria spores called Bacillus anthracis. The disease is still one of the health problems of developing countries. Due to fatigue and decreased visual acuity, microscopic diagnosis of diseases by humans may not be of good quality. In this paper, for the first time, a system for automatic and rapid diagnosis of anthrax disease simultaneously with detection and segmentation of B. anthracis bacteria in microscopic images has been proposed based on artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques. Two important architectures of deep neural networks including UNet and UNet++ have been used for detection and segmentation of the most important component of the image i.e. bacteria. Automated detection and segmentation of B. anthracis bacteria offers the same level of accuracy as the human diagnostic specialist and in some cases outperforms it. Experimental results show that these deep architectures especially UNet++ can be used effectively and efficiently to automate B. anthracis bacteria segmentation of microscopic images obtained under different conditions. UNet++ produces outstanding results despite the many challenges in this field, such as high image dimension, image artifacts, object crowding, and overlapping. We conducted our experiments on a dataset prepared privately and achieved an accuracy of 97% and the dice score of 0.96 on the patch test images. It also tested on whole raw images and a recall of 98% and accuracy of 97% is achieved, which shows excellent performance in the bacteria segmentation task. The low cost and high speed of diagnosis and no need for a specialist are other benefits of the proposed system.\n",

            "                  This study is an add-on analysis of a clinical trial that investigated the performance of AI for differentiating colorectal polyps (ie, neoplastic versus non-neoplastic). We included all patients with diminutive (≤5 mm) rectosigmoid polyps in the analyses. The average colonoscopy cost was compared for 2 scenarios: (1) a diagnose-and-leave strategy supported by the AI prediction (ie, diminutive rectosigmoid polyps were not removed when predicted as non-neoplastic), and (2) a resect-all-polyps strategy. Gross annual costs for colonoscopies were also calculated based on the number and reimbursement of colonoscopies conducted under public health insurances in 4 countries.\n",

            "                  SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new Coronavirus, with first reported human infections in late 2019. COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 have not been completely understood yet. More than 200,000 persons were killed during this epidemic (till 1 May 2020). Therefore, developing forecasting models to predict the spread of that epidemic is a critical issue. In this study, statistical and artificial intelligence based approaches have been proposed to model and forecast the prevalence of this epidemic in Egypt. These approaches are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). The official data reported by The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population of COVID-19 cases in the period between 1 March and 10 May 2020 was used to train the models. The forecasted cases showed a good agreement with officially reported cases. The obtained results of this study may help the Egyptian decision-makers to put short-term future plans to face this epidemic.\n",

            "                  The developments in the medical systems, especially in health care management systems, play a vital role in patients. The effective management of health records leads to an increase in the importance of the healthcare management system all over the world. A real-time health monitoring system is a key zone for the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor technology in human services using Big Data Analytics. The major challenge that has to do with the health care data sets is security and privacy. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based heuristic health management system has been designed and developed. This system is exceptionally close to improve the security and privacy of the live datasets of patients and the association of medicinal services over its different viewpoints. These services include the capacity for specialists, experts, attendants, and staff to settle on better decisions faster. Moreover, security and quality of data by configuration should be a part of any IoT use case, task or arrangement. Utilizing IoT assisted artificial intelligent based heuristic health management system intends to improve and minimize the security risk on health care data sets with assisted IoT sensors. The experimental results show promising outcomes in terms of various performance factors. The system attains precision as 99.75%, error rate as 0.0646 and predicted positive condition rate as 98.46%, Informedness as 98.6% and accuracy as 99.66%. The system is implemented using the MATLAB program.\n",

            "                  Big data and artificial intelligence develop rapidly. Big data analysis has been applied in many fields of smart healthcare. Once these data are leaked or modified during transmission, it will not only invade the privacy of patients, but also endanger their lives. Many researchers worked on encrypted personal health records (PHR). However, there are still some challenges, such as data leakage during deep learning and leakage of training models, and some users do not want their data to be leaked to the analysis organization. How to protect privacy while leveraging deep learning is a pressing issue. In this paper, we present a system for predicting disease and timely alarms by collecting data from sensors and using deep learning to analyze and monitor patient health data. In order to protect the privacy of health data, we adopt an assured data deletion approach which the data owner can choose to revoke some users’ access to their health data. Extensive analysis and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the security, and efficiency of our proposed approach.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Enabling full interoperability within and between population-based patient-registry domains would open up access to a rich and unique source of health data for secondary data usage. Previous attempts to tackle patient-registry interoperability have met with varying degrees of success, but a unifying solution remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to show by practical example how a solution is attainable via the implementation of an existing framework based of the concept of federated, semantic metadata registries. One important feature motivating the use of this framework is that it can be implemented gradually and independently within each patient-registry domain. By employing linked open data principles, the framework extends the ISO/IEC 11179 standard to provide both syntactic and semantic interoperability of data elements with the means of specifying automated extraction scripts for retrieval of data from different registry content models. The examples provided address the domain of European population-based cancer registries to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. One of the examples shows how quick gains are derivable by allowing retrieval of aggregated core data sets. The other examples show how aggregated full sets of data and record-level data might also be retrieved from each local registry. An infrastructure of patient-registry domains adhering to the principles of the framework would provide the semantic contexts and inter-linkage of data necessary for automated search and retrieval of registry data. It would thereby also lay the foundation for making registry data serviceable to artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n",

            "                  Global Health sometimes faces pandemics as are currently facing COVID-19 disease. The spreading and infection factors of this disease are very high. A huge number of people from most of the countries are infected within six months from its first report of appearance and it keeps spreading. The required systems are not ready up to some stages for any pandemic; therefore, mitigation with existing capacity becomes necessary. On the other hand, modern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data Science; and Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques. It could use to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, patient care, and many more. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. A shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. So, Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could work on another task. In addition, Edge Devices(ED) such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are very useful in a pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreak. But these are equipped with low computing resources, so, applying DL is also a bit challenging; therefore, DTL also would be effective there. This article scholarly studies the potentiality and challenges of these issues. It has described relevant technical backgrounds and reviews of the related recent state-of-the-art. This article also draws a pipeline of DTL over Edge Computing as a future scope to assist the mitigation of any pandemic.\n",

            "                  Injuries exert an enormous impact on athletes and teams. This is seen especially in professional soccer, with a marked negative impact on team performance and considerable costs of rehabilitation for players. Existing studies provide some preliminary understanding of which factors are mostly associated with injury risk, but scientific systematic evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. Some factors raise the risk of a sport injury, but there are also elements that predispose athletes to sports injuries. The biological mechanisms involved in non-contact musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are poorly understood. Genetic risk factors may be associated with susceptibility to injuries, and may exert marked influence on recovery times. Athletes are complex systems, and depend on internal and external factors to attain and maintain stability of their health and their performance. Organisms, participants or traits within a dynamic system adapt and change when factors within that system change. Scientists routinely predict risk in a variety of dynamic systems, including weather, political forecasting and projecting traffic fatalities and the last years have started the use of predictive models in the human health industry. We propose that the use of artificial intelligence may well help in assessing risk and help to predict the occurrence of sport injuries.\n",

For step 1, a DL algorithm was developed to locate the optic disc, the “landmark feature.” For step 2, based on the location of the optic disc derived from step 1, a rule-based classifier was developed to sort retinal photographs into 3 types: macular-centered, optic disc–centered, or related to other fields. Step 2 concurrently distinguished laterality (i.e., the left or right eye) of macular-centered photographs. For step 3, an additional DL algorithm was developed to differentiate the laterality of disc-centered photographs. Via the 3 steps, RetiSort sorted and labeled retinal images into (1) right macular–centered, (2) left macular–centered, (3) right optic disc–centered, (4) left optic disc–centered, and (5) images relating to other fields. Subsequently, the accuracy of RetiSort was evaluated on 5000 randomly selected retinal images from SEED as well as on 3 publicly available image databases (DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS). The main outcome measure was the accuracy for sorting of retinal photographs.\n",

In external tests, RetiSort mislabeled 1, 0, and 2 images, respectively, from DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS, representing an accuracy of 99.2% (95% CI, 95.8–99.9), 100%, and 98.0% (95% CI, 93.1–99.8), respectively.

            "                  Abstract\n",
            "                  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous entity of B-cell lymphoma. Cell-of-origin (COO) classification of DLBCL is required in routine practice by the World Health Organization classification for biological and therapeutic insights. Genetic subtypes uncovered recently are based on distinct genetic alterations in DLBCL, which are different from the COO subtypes defined by gene expression signatures of normal B cells retained in DLBCL. We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training set was robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell–like compared with the germinal-center B-cell–like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application. The clinical grade assays and NGS models integrating both genetic and transcriptional factors developed in this study may eventually support precision medicine in DLBCL.\n",

The collagen aggregates (CA) derived from chromium-containing waste leather were used as the substrate while polyaniline (PANi)-acidified multi-walled carbon nanotube (H-MWNTs) composites were employed as the conductive materials (P-M). The multi-functional flexible sensor was assembled resulting in multi-dimensional recognition ability (including compressing (gauge factor (GF) = 5.2), bending (GF = 9.2), and twisting strains), fast response (110 ms), and broad dynamic response range (28 Pa–100 KPa). Notably, the multi-functional sensor had superior sensing performance to humidity and comfortable wearing performance. Owing to these merits, the fabricated sensor with multi-functionality and intelligence can potentially act as the artificial skin for robot hand to detect weak pressure and humidity changes, displaying great promise for applications in the fields of real-time health monitoring, biomedical, and intelligent robots.\n",

            "                  Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) play a vital role in the upcoming years to improve the assistance systems. The IoT devices utilize several sensor devices that able to collect a large volume of data in different domains which is processed by AI techniques to make the decision about the assistance problems. Among several applications, in this work, IoT with AI is used to examine the healthcare sectors to improve patient assistance and patient care in the future direction. Traditional health care assistance system fails to predict the exact patient health information and needs which reduces the accuracy of patient assistance process. For these issues, an IoT sensor with AI is used to predict the exact patient details such as fitness tracker, medical reports, health activity, body mass, temperature, and other health care information which helps to choose the right assistance process. Healthcare mobile application is used to achieve this goal and collect the patient’s information. This information is shared in the cloud environment, which is accessed and processed by applying the optimized machine learning techniques. The gathered patient details are processed according to the iterative golden section optimized deep belief neural network (IGDBN). The introduced network examines the patient’s details from the previous health information which helps to predict the exact patient health condition in the future direction. The efficiency of IoT sensor with an AI-based health assistance prediction process is developed using MATLAB tool. Excellence is determined in terms of precision (99.87), loss error (0.045), simple matching coefficient (99.71%), Matthews correlation coefficient (99.10%) and accuracy (99.86%).\n",

            "                  In recent times, we assist to an ever growing diffusion of smart medical sensors and Internet of things devices that are heavily changing the way healthcare is approached worldwide. In this context, a combination of Cloud and IoT architectures is often exploited to make smart healthcare systems capable of supporting near realtime applications when processing and performing Artificial Intelligence on the huge amount of data produced by wearable sensor networks. Anyway, the response time and the availability of cloud based systems, together with security and privacy, still represent critical issues that prevents Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and architectures from being a reliable and effective solution to the aim. Lately, there is a growing interest towards architectures and approaches that exploit Edge and Fog computing as an answer to compensate the weaknesses of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a short review about the general use of IoT solutions in health care, starting from early health monitoring solutions from wearable sensors up to a discussion about the latest trends in fog/edge computing for smart health.\n",

Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network. Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks. We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent efforts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of artificial intelligence. This model can be adjusted to describe past outbreaks as well as COVID-19.

            "                  Wearable electronics and smart garments have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in health care monitoring, artificial intelligence, soft robotics, etc. However, designing robust and flexible wearable electronics that can shield electromagnetic waves and work in all-weather environment or even harsh conditions remains a challenge. Herein, superhydrophobic and multi-responsive fabric composites with outstanding electro-photo-thermal effect and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) performance are fabricated by decoration of conductive Ag nanoparticles onto the oxygen plasma treated polypropylene (PP) fabric, followed by multiple spray-coating with a mixture of Fe3O4 nanoparticles/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The obtained fabric composites exhibit high conductivity (up to 108.8 S/cm) and the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) can reach as high as ~56.1 dB in the X band, in which of the incident electromagnetic waves can account for 30%. Moreover, the PDMS coating not only improves the interface adhesion between the nanoparticles and fibers, but also endows the fabric composites with superhydrophobicity, leading to an excellent self-cleaning performance. Surprisingly, the fabric composites also exhibit multiple responsive properties to electron and light, known as electro-photo-thermal effect, which can be maintained during mechanical deformations and cold environment. This work opens a new avenue for next-generation of wearable electronics with multi-functionality.\n",

Recently there has been increasing attention in the health area, and there exist different approaches based on artificial intelligence that have been proposed in the diagnosis of several kinds of diseases. In particular, fuzzy systems have been successfully used as Diagnosis Systems, in this way helping doctors to realize a faster and more accurate diagnosis. However, with the emergence of Type-2 Fuzzy Systems, there have been important improvements in handling the uncertainty with respect to traditional Fuzzy Systems (now called Type-1 Fuzzy Systems) in different kinds of problems. In the present paper, a new approach to Fuzzy Diagnosis based on Type-2 Fuzzy Systems is proposed and compared with respect to Type-1 Fuzzy Systems on a set of diagnosis problems, in order to evaluate the relevance of the uncertainty handling in this kind of problems. On the other hand, the paper is also aiming at observing the accuracy behavior in Fuzzy Diagnosis Systems by changing the uncertainty level in the models. Finally, a comparison of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Systems with respect to General Type-2 Fuzzy Systems for a set of diagnosis problems is presented.\n",

Since availability of personnel trained for field scouting is a major problem, small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors can simplify the surveying procedure, decrease data collection time, and reduce cost. To accurate and rapidly process, analyze and visualize data collected from UAVs and other platforms (e.g. small airplanes, satellites, ground platforms), a cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) based application (named Agroview) was developed. This interactive and user-friendly application can: (i) detect, count and geo-locate plants and plant gaps (locations with dead or no plants); (ii) measure plant height and canopy size (plant inventory); (iii) develop plant health (or stress) maps. In this study, the use of this Agroview application to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus trees (as a case study) is presented. It was found, that this emerging technology detected citrus trees with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.3% in a commercial citrus orchard with 175,977 trees (1,871 acres; 39 normal and high-density spacing blocks). Furthermore, it accurately estimated tree height with 4.5% and 12.93% MAPE for normal and high-density spacing respectively, and canopy size with MAPE of 12.9% and 34.6% for normal and high-density spacing respectively. It provides a consistent, more direct, cost-effective and rapid method for field survey and plant phenotyping.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Automated detection of pain intensity from facial expressions, especially from face images that show a patient's health, remains a significant challenge in the medical diagnostics and health informatics area. Expert systems that prudently analyse facial expression images, utilising an automated machine learning algorithm, can be a promising approach for pain intensity analysis in health domain. Deep neural networks and emerging machine learning techniques have made significant progress in both the feature identification, mapping and the modelling of pain intensity from facial images, with great potential to aid health practitioners in the diagnosis of certain medical conditions. Consequently, there has been significant research within the pain recognition and management area that aim to adopt facial expression datasets into deep learning algorithms to detect the pain intensity in binary classes, and also to identify pain and non-pain faces. However, the volume of research in identifying pain intensity levels in multi-classes remains rather limited. This paper reports on a new enhanced deep neural network framework designed for the effective detection of pain intensity, in four-level thresholds using a facial expression image. To explore the robustness of the proposed algorithms, the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Archive Database, comprised of human facial images, was first balanced, then used for the training and testing of the classification model, coupled with the fine-tuned VGG-Face pre-trainer as a feature extraction tool. To reduce the dimensionality of the classification model input data and extract most relevant features, Principal Component Analysis was applied, improving its computational efficiency. The pre-screened features, used as model inputs, are then transferred to produce a new enhanced joint hybrid CNN-BiLSTM (EJH-CNN-BiLSTM) deep learning algorithm comprised of convolutional neural networks, that were then linked to the joint bidirectional LSTM, for multi-classification of pain. The resulting EJH-CNN-BiLSTM classification model, tested to estimate four different levels of pain, revealed a good degree of accuracy in terms of different performance evaluation techniques. The results indicated that the enhanced EJH-CNN-BiLSTM classification algorithm was explored as a potential tool for the detection of pain intensity in multi-classes from facial expression images, and therefore, can be adopted as an artificial intelligence tool in the medical diagnostics for automatic pain detection and subsequent pain management of patients.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Blood glycemic control is crucial for minimizing severe side effects in diabetes mellitus. Currently, two opposing treatment approaches exist: in formulaic methods, insulin care is calculated by parameter-based computation (i.e., correction factor, insulin-to-carb ratio, and absorption duration), which are fixed by the medical team based on the history of a tested patient blood glucose levels (BGLs). Alternatively, closed-loop methods test glycemic level via sensors and provide insulin boluses based on sensor data thus ignoring other medical information. Unlike the body, both these systems are reactive – chasing insulin dosage based on fluctuating BGL – resulting in significant fluctuations of glucose values, rather than the relatively flat profile normal to the body's glycemic control. Extended periods of these fluctuations – particularly high BGLs (hyperglycemia) result in vascular and organ epithelial damage, which increases comorbidities and is ultimately life-threatening. We propose an individualized treatment scheme based on machine learning artificial intelligence, which combines the best of both approaches and is tailored to the individual. We model patient reaction to insulin treatment as Markov decision process (MDP) thus allowing the system to find a unique, individualized and dynamically updating insulin care policy that would lead to flat blood glucose profiles in target areas. We incorporate an individualized “health reward function”, preferably from the medical team, describing a grading scheme of BGL tailored to the patient for even more precise glycemic control. The solution to MDP is found via reinforcement learning, which yields an individualized, optimal insulin care policy. This policy can prevent hypoglycemia, minimize high glucose duration and glycemic fluctuations. It can be further updated as the patient undergoes environmental changes. Significantly, our method provides the care team a constantly updated patient model, allowing them to better understand and support the patient.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Background Anaemia is an important health-care burden globally, and screening for anaemia is crucial to prevent multi-organ injury, irreversible complications, and life-threatening adverse events. We aimed to establish whether a deep learning algorithm (DLA) that enables non-invasive anaemia screening from electrocardiograms (ECGs) might improve the detection of anaemia. Methods We did a retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in which a DLA was developed using ECGs and then internally and externally validated. We used data from two hospitals, Sejong General Hospital (hospital A) and Mediplex Sejong Hospital (hospital B), in South Korea. Data from hospital A was for DLA development and internal validation, and data from hospital B was for external validation. We included individuals who had at least one ECG with a haemoglobin measurement within 1 h of the index ECG and excluded individuals with missing demographic, electrocardiographic, or haemoglobin information. Three types of DLA were developed with 12-lead, 6-lead (limb lead), and single-lead (lead I) ECGs to detect haemoglobin concentrations of 10 g/dL or less. The DLA was built by a convolutional neural network and used 500-Hz raw ECG, age, and sex as input data. Findings The study period ran from Oct 1, 2016, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital A and March 1, 2017, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital B. 40 513 patients at hospital A and 4737 patients at hospital B were eligible for inclusion. We excluded 281 patients at hospital A and 72 patients at hospital B because of missing values for clinical information and ECG data. The development dataset comprised 57 435 ECGs from 31 898 patients, and the algorithm was internally validated with 7974 ECGs from 7974 patients. The external validation dataset included 4665 ECGs from 4665 patients. 586 (internal) and 194 (external) patients within the combined dataset were found to be anaemic. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of the DLA using a 12-lead ECG for detecting anaemia was 0·923 for internal validation and 0·901 for external validation. Using a 90% sensitivity operating point for the development data, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of internal validation were 89·8%, 81·5%, 99·4%, and 20·0%, respectively, and those of external validation were 86·1%, 76·2%, 99·2%, and 13·5%, respectively. The DLA focused on the QRS complex for deciding the presence of anaemia in a sensitivity map. The AUROCs of DLAs using 6 leads and a single lead were in the range of 0·841–0·890. Interpretation In this study, using raw ECG data, a DLA accurately detected anaemia. The application of artificial intelligence to ECGs could enable screening for anaemia. Funding None.\n",

            "                  Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches have caught the attention of many in health care. Current literature suggests there are many potential benefits that could transform future clinical workflows and decision making. Embedding AI and ML concepts in radiation therapy education could be a fundamental step in equipping radiation therapists (RTs) to engage in competent and safe practice as they utilise clinical technologies. In this discussion paper, the authors provide a brief review of some applications of AI and ML in radiation therapy and discuss pertinent considerations for radiation therapy curriculum enhancement. As the current literature suggests, AI and ML approaches will impose changes to routine clinical radiation therapy tasks. The emphasis in RT education could be on critical evaluation of AI and ML application in routine clinical workflows and gaining an understanding of the impact on quality assurance, provision of quality of care and safety in radiation therapy as well as research. It is also imperative RTs have a broader understanding of AI/ML impact on health care, including ethical and legal considerations. The paper concludes with recommendations and suggestions to deliberately embed AI and ML aspects in RT education to empower future RT practitioners.\n",

            "                  The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients.\n",

These models demonstrated a low mean absolute relative error (0.10 and 0.09 respectively) and high correlation coefficient values (0.98 and 0.78). The GS-GMDH model for THR demonstrated 6.4/1000 person years (PYs) at the mid-point of the linear regression line post-NICE, whereas at the same point linear regression is 4.12/1000 PYs, a difference of around 35%. Similarly for the TKR, the linear regression to the datasets post-NICE was 9.05/1000 PYs, which is lower by about 27% than the GS-GMDH values of 12.47/1000 PYs.

            "                  Passengers are directly or indirectly exposed to fine dust in indoor air of underground subway stations, which greatly affects the comfort and health of the passengers. However, conventional ventilation systems are manually operated, resulting in high energy consumption, and it is hard to consider the dynamic characteristics of indoor air quality due to the complex relationships between the environment of the subway station and climate change-driven outdoor air quality. Therefore, an energy-efficient ventilation optimization system based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-iterative dynamic programming was developed in this study for proactive environmental and economic maintenance of the underground ventilation system for a subway’s indoor air quality. The deep learning model predicted the next 24 h of the subway’s environmental status, and the AI-iterative dynamic programming searched a piecewise operational policy of ventilation flow rate for the same operational duration. Energy efficiency was improved by 8.68% while maintaining healthy indoor air quality for the passengers. The proactive optimal ventilation system for the platform of a target subway station presented a decrease of 96 tons of CO2 per year to help address climate change and operating expenditure savings of up to $4217 dollars per year.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Monitoring air quality in urban and industrial environments and estimating exposure to particulate matter (PM) pollution concentrations are critical issues that affect human health. Because of aerosols (suspended particles), PM is mostly observed near the surface and thus can be inhaled. To predict the modeling of micro-to-nano-sized particle suspensions, this study presents a stochastic model in environmental dynamics with internet of things (IoT) gas detectors based on an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technique; the model can determine floating fine PM dispersion in a city to assess and monitor air quality. The factors that influence the prediction are weather- and air pollution-related data, such as humidity, temperature, wind, PM2.5, and PM10. In this study, these factors have been considered at 7 measuring stations across the urban region in Taipei City, Taiwan, from 2013 to 2018. A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs model is constructed using estimated states to investigate approaches for identifying PM; the model can be a state–space self-tuning stochastic model for predicting unknown nonlinear sampled data. The results indicate that a satisfactory agreement was obtained using a normalized root mean square deviation, with small values of 0.0504 and 0.0802 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. Accordingly, this study presents that the time-domain causality between PM and the atmospheric environment can be constructed using discrete-time models that can be satisfactorily implemented in developing different air quality monitoring systems for the long-term prediction of air pollution.\n",

New generations of wearables are emerging, driven by consumers’ demand to monitor their own health. With the ongoing development of new features capable of assessing real-time biometric data, the impact of wearables on cardiovascular management has become inevitable. Smartwatches, among other wearable devices, offer a user-friendly noninvasive approach to continuously monitor for health parameters. With advancements in artificial intelligence, the photoplethysmography-generated pulse waveform has the potential to accurately detect episodes of atrial fibrillation and one day could replace conventional diagnostic and long-term monitoring methods. Clinical benefits that could arise from the use of such devices include refining stroke prevention strategies, personalizing AF management, and optimizing the patient–physician relationship. Wearables are changing not only the way clinicians conduct research but also the future of cardiovascular preventive and therapeutic care. As such, wearables are here to stay.\n",

Wearable devices may be an ideal solution. Objective The purpose of this study was to measure the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a recently developed smart wristband device that is equipped with both photoplethysmographic (PPG) and single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) systems and an AF-identifying, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, used in the short term. Methods Use of the Amazfit Health Band 1S, which records both PPG and single-channel ECG data, was assessed in 401 patients (251 normal individuals and 150 ECG-diagnosed AF patients). Results ECG and PPG readings could not be judged in 15 and 18 subjects, respectively. Subjects who were unable to be judged were defined as either false negative or false positive. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of wristband PPG readings were 88.00%, 96.41%, and 93.27%, respectively, and those of wristband ECG readings were 87.33%, 99.20%, and 94.76%, respectively. When the original wristband ECG records were judged by physicians, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 96.67%, 98.01%, and 97.51%, respectively.

However, most of these games such as Atari took place in 2D environments that were not fully observable to the agents. Currently, it is of extreme significance to employ such machine learning techniques and methods in 3D environments such as Doom. Therefore, In this paper, we train agents on the health gathering scenario of the classical first-person shooter game Doom by first presenting the Direct Future Prediction to train an agent that uses a simple architecture with no additional supervisory signals, then differentiate and compare the performance of the agents trained by using several different machine learning techniques, and the AI reinforcement learning platform ‘VizDoom’, a 3D partially observable environment, with interesting enhanced properties that makes agents to stand out from inbuilt AI agents and human players. We have continued to use computer games as a benchmark for the performance of AI as having been so successful in the past. We also compared the results of our findings to conclude the performance of the agents trained with different machine learning techniques. The agents performed well against both human players and inbuilt game agents.\n",

Negation detection is a key for decision support systems since negated events (detection of absence of some events) help ascertain current medical conditions. For artificial intelligence, negation detection is a valuable point as it can revert the meaning of a part of a text and, accordingly, influence other tasks such as medical dosage adjustment, the detection of adverse drug reactions or hospital acquired diseases.\n",

Currently we have implemented an integrated system which connects nurses, physicians and scientists, in a network of cooperation to identify and report suspicious cases of pulmonary TB. Our Electronic Mobile system (called ‘eRx’) is a Computer Automated Diagnosis (CAD) tool that can be used by local TB nurses allowing them to send X-rays along with additional prospect patient information, directly to be remotely evaluated by a physician. The physician accesses a web-based system using a computer or a tablet which allows him/her to evaluate the data coming from the distinct healthcare centers. The physician may also be assisted by a Beta version of an automatic diagnostic software which uses Deep Learning to identify the presence of lung abnormalities as well as the possible manifestations for TB. The goal of our research is to increase the speed at which a diagnosis can be made by providing a CAD tool to health care providers to improve quality and efficiency of TB diagnosis.\n",

The software for the eRx system covers the obtaining of high-quality data, artificial intelligence support and mobile technologies directly in hands of the healthcare professionals, each software has already been validated individually, and will be evaluated together during a pilot study working directly with local healthcare centers, physicians and nurses.

A hotspot score signifies the abnormality seen from irregular asymmetric heat patterns seen on the skin surface, whereas vascular score predicts the presence of asymmetric vascular activity. These scores are generated using machine learning algorithms over medically interpretable parameters that describes the metabolic activity inside the breast tissue and indicate the presence of a possible malignancy even in asymptomatic women.\n",

            "                  The proposed personalized risk score was tested on 769 subjects in four breast cancer screening facilities. The subjects’ age ranged from 18 to 82 years with a median of around 45 years. Out of the 769 subjects, 185 subjects were diagnosed with a breast malignancy by an expert radiologist after mammography, ultrasound and/or histopathology. Our personalized AI based risk score achieved an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 0.89 when compared to an age normalized risk score that showed an AUC of 0.68. We also found that if the computed risk score is used to place individuals into four risk groups, the likelihood of malignancy also increases monotonically with the risk grouping level.\n",

            "                  The proposed AI based personalized risk score uses breast thermal image patterns for risk computation and compares favorably to other generic risk estimation approaches. The proposed risk framework solution is automated, affordable, non-invasive, non-contact and radiation free and works for a wide age range of women from 18 to 82 years, including young women with dense breasts. The proposed score might be further used to assign subjects into one of the four risk groups and provide guidance on the periodicity of screening needed. In addition, the automatically annotated thermal images localizes the potential abnormal regions and might empower the physician to create a better personalized care.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Communication is a core component of effective healthcare that impacts many patient and doctor outcomes, yet is complex and challenging to both analyse and teach. Human-based coding and audit systems are time-intensive and costly; thus, there is considerable interest in the application of artificial intelligence to this topic, through machine learning using both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. In this article we introduce health communication, its importance for patient and health professional outcomes, and the need for rigorous empirical data to support this field. We then discuss historical interaction coding systems and recent developments in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to automate such coding in the health setting. Finally, we discuss available evidence for the reliability and validity of AI coding, application of AI in training and audit of communication, as well as limitations and future directions in this field. In summary, recent advances in machine learning have allowed accurate textual transcription, and analysis of prosody, pauses, energy, intonation, emotion and communication style. Studies have established moderate to good reliability of machine learning algorithms, comparable with human coding (or better), and have identified some expected and unexpected associations between communication variables and patient satisfaction. Finally, application of artificial intelligence to communication skills training has been attempted, to provide audit and feedback, and through the use of avatars. This looks promising to provide confidential and easily accessible training, but may be best used as an adjunct to human-based training.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) is the most commonly used free flap in mastectomy reconstruction. Preoperative imaging techniques are routinely used to detect location, diameter and course of perforators, with direct intervention from the imaging team, who subsequently draw a chart that will help surgeons choosing the best vascular support for the reconstruction. In this work, the feasibility of using a computer software to support the preoperative planning of 40 patients proposed for breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap is evaluated for the first time. Blood vessel centreline extraction and local characterization algorithms are applied to identify perforators and compared with the manual mapping, aiming to reduce the time spent by the imaging team, as well as the inherent subjectivity to the task. Comparing with the measures taken during surgery, the software calibre estimates were worse for vessels smaller than 1.5 mm (P = 6e-4) but better for the remaining ones (P = 2e-3). Regarding vessel location, the vertical component of the software output was significantly different from the manual measure (P = 0.02), nonetheless that was irrelevant during surgery as errors in the order of 2–3 mm do not have impact in the dissection step. Our trials support that a reduction of the time spent is achievable using the automatic tool (about 2 h/case). The introduction of artificial intelligence in clinical practice intends to simplify the work of health professionals and to provide better outcomes to patients. This pilot study paves the way for a success story.\n",

Methods The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (n = 3318) and normotensive pregnant women (n = 19,883) from all women with one pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing techniques to interpret our modeling results. Findings The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a random forest algorithm. Nine∼12 months to the event was the period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either geographical (0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88–0.89) or temporal split (0.86, 95% CI 0.85–0.86). We compared this model to prediction models in seven studies from 869 records in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This model outperformed the previous models in terms of the precision, sensitivity, and specificity in all validation sets. Interpretation Our low-cost model improved preliminary prediction to decide pregnant women that will be predicted by the models with high specificity and advanced predictors.

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most important health problems and global action plans have been proposed globally. Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE = (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE = (0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions.\n",

            "                  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important tools for assessing cardiac function and detecting potential heart problems. However, most of the current ECG report records remain on the paper, which makes it difficult to preserve and analyze the data. Moreover, paper records could result in the loss significant data, which brings inconvenience to the subsequent clinical diagnosis or artificial intelligence-assisted heart health diagnosis. Taking digital pictures is an intuitive way of preserving these files and can be done simply using smartphones or any other devices with cameras. However, these real scene ECG images often have some image noise that hinders signal extraction. How to eliminate image noise and extract ECG binary image automatically from the noisy and low-quality real scene images of ECG reports is the first problem to be solved in this paper. Next, QRS recognition is implemented on the extracted binary images to determine key points of ECG signals. 1D digital ECG signal is also extracted for accessing the exact values of the extracted points. In light of these tasks, an automatic digital ECG signal extraction and normal QRS recognition from real scene ECG images is proposed in this paper.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Modelling air quality with a practical tool that produces real-time forecasts to mitigate risk to public health continues to face significant challenges considering the chaotic, non-linear and high dimensional nature of air quality predictor variables. The novelty of this research is to propose a hybrid early-warning artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can emulate hourly air quality variables (i.e., Particulate Matter 2.5, PM2.5; Particulate Matter 10, PM10 and lower atmospheric visibility, VIS), the atmospheric variables associated with increased respiratory induced mortality and recurrent health-care cost. Firstly, hourly air quality data series (January-2015 to December-2017) are demarcated into their respective intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual sub-series that reveal patterns and resolve data complexity characteristics, followed by partial autocorrelation function applied to each IMF and residual sub-series to unveil historical changes in air quality. To design the prescribed hybrid model, the data is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%) and testing (15%) sub-sets. The online sequential-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm integrated with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) is designed as a data pre-processing system to robustly extract predictive patterns and fine-tune the model generalization to a near-optimal global solution, which represents modelled air quality at hourly forecast horizons. The resulting early warning AI-based framework denoted as ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM model, is individually constructed by forecasting each IMF and residual sub-series, with hourly PM2.5, PM10, and VIS obtained by the aggregated sum of forecasted IMFs and residual sub-series. The results are benchmarked with many competing predictive approaches; e.g., hybrid ICEEMDAN-multiple-linear regression (MLR), ICEEMDAN-M5 model tree and standalone versions: OS-ELM, MLR, M5 model tree.

In parallel with recent developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and image processing, embedded systems are also used in decision support systems for tumor diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM), is a recently developed, quick and efficient algorithm which can quickly and flawlessly diagnose tumors using machine learning techniques. Similarly, significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FRFCM) is a novel and fast algorithm which can display a high performance. In the present study, a brain tumor segmentation approach is proposed based on extreme learning machine and significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms (BTS-ELM-FRFCM) running on Raspberry Pi (PRI) hardware. The present study mainly aims to introduce a new segmentation system hardware containing new algorithms and offering a high level of accuracy the health sector. PRI’s are useful mobile devices due to their cost-effectiveness and satisfying hardware. 3200 training images were used to train ELM in the present study. 20 pieces of MRI images were used for testing process. Figure of merid (FOM), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) and Dice indexes were used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed method was compared with brain tumor segmentation based on support vector machine (BTS-SVM), brain tumor segmentation based on fuzzy C-means (BTS-FCM) and brain tumor segmentation based on self-organizing maps and k-means (BTS-SOM). The statistical analysis on FOM, JSC and Dice results obtained using four different approaches indicated that BTS-ELM-FRFCM displayed the highest performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the embedded system designed in the present study can perform brain tumor segmentation with a high accuracy rate.\n",

In particular, machine learning and bio-inspired learning algorithms provides the effective solutions in image processing techniques. However, the implementation of the above-mentioned algorithms in the general CPU requires the intensive usage of bandwidth, area and power which makes the CPU unhealthy of usage and implementation. To overcome this problem, ASIC (application specific integrated circuits), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) &FPGA (Field Programmable gate arrays) have been employed to improve the performance of the hybrid machine learning (ML) classifiers and deep learning algorithms. FPGA has been recently employed for an effective implementation and to achieve the high performance of the learning algorithms. But integrating the complex learning algorithms in FPGA still remains to be real challenge among the researchers. The paper proposes new reconfigurable architectures for bio- inspired classifiers to diagnosis the medical casualties which can be suitable for the tele health care applications.

The major challenges are a limited number of sensors, reliable data collection and processing, and deployment of computationally efficient algorithms. In this multi-cohort study, we have used everyday wearables such as chest band and smartwatch to investigate the heart rate variability (HRV) of 131 subjects which include 40 healthy controls, 69 asthma patients, 9 COPD patients and 13 patients with a co-morbidity of asthma and COPD. We aimed at a comprehensive investigation by exploring a total of 58 features including time domain, frequency domain, non-linear and entropy measures of HRV to identify the HRV indices that provide significant discriminatory information for classification between healthy and pulmonary patients. Feature ranking has been done by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Classification of patients with the 15 top ranked features using data from the chest band heart rate sensor as well as estimated HRV parameters from smartwatch PPG signal have been investigated separately. Using the chest band data, a classification accuracy of 82.07%, precision of 83.13%, recall of 81.53% and F-1 score of 81.7% have been achieved; whereas using the smartwatch data, a classification accuracy of 80%, precision of 79.9%, recall of 80% and F-1 score of 79.94% have been achieved for the test set with an AdaBoost classifier. Heart rate variability metrics also showed significant correlation with disease severity and impact on health-related quality of life as measured by pulmonary function test, Asthma Symptoms Utility Index and COPD assessment test score respectively. The results indicate that HRV analysis using everyday wearables may be helpful in the assessment and management of asthma and COPD.\n",

Unfortunately, individual institutions often lack sufficient samples, which might not provide sufficient statistical power for models. One mitigation is to expand data collection from a single institution to multiple centers to collectively increase the sample size. However, sharing sensitive biomedical data for research involves complicated issues. Machine learning models such as random forests (RF), though they are commonly used and achieve good performances for prognostic prediction, usually suffer worse performance under multicenter privacy-preserving data mining scenarios compared to a centrally trained version.\n",

Then, we compare the discrimination and calibration ability of the proposed multicenter random forest with a centrally trained random forest model and other tree-based classifiers as well as some commonly used machine learning methods. The results show that the proposed model can provide better prediction performance in terms of discrimination and calibration ability than the centrally trained RF model or the other candidate models while following the privacy-preserving rules in both groups. Additionally, good discrimination and calibration ability are shown on the simplified model based on the feature importance ranking in the proposed approach.\n",

            "                  Fabrication of anisotropic piezoresistive materials is ultimately important for the realization of multi-loading recognization in robotics, auto-driving, artificial intelligence and health care, etc., whereas most of the existing production strategies are time-consuming and costly. Herein, we applied a simple structural design of carbonized cotton thread (CCT) to produce anisotropic piezoresistive CCT/silicone composites. Specifically, the rectangular wave shaped CCT/silicone composite (Re-CCT) and straight CCT/silicone composite (St-CCT), which exhibit distinct sensing performance to tension and compression, are fabricated. Their sensors’ gauge factor (GF) for tension and compression obeys: GFTen-St > GFCom-St ≈ GFCom-Re > GFTen-Re ≈ 0. Consequently, the flexible multifunctional anisotropic piezoresistive composite integrated with Re-CCT and St-CCT is able to distinguish multiple loading modes, including compression, tension and their combination, via monitoring the micro-deformation applied by a finger and the status of a bottle handled by a robotic hand. The current strategy shows a great promise in manufacturing flexible anisotropic piezoresistive composite sensors for robotics, auto-driving, artificial intelligence and health care applications, etc.\n",

We consider potential effects for patients, including on trust in healthcare, and provide some social science explanations for the apparent rush to implement AI solutions. We conclude by anticipating future directions for AI in breast cancer care. Stakeholders in healthcare AI should acknowledge that their enterprise is an ethical, legal and social challenge, not just a technical challenge. Taking these challenges seriously will require broad engagement, imposition of conditions on implementation, and pre-emptive systems of oversight to ensure that development does not run ahead of evaluation and deliberation. Once artificial intelligence becomes institutionalised, it may be difficult to reverse: a proactive role for government, regulators and professional groups will help ensure introduction in robust research contexts, and the development of a sound evidence base regarding real-world effectiveness. Detailed public discussion is required to consider what kind of AI is acceptable rather than simply accepting what is offered, thus optimising outcomes for health systems, professionals, society and those receiving care.\n",

AI-powered IoT enabled disruptive changes and unique opportunities to the healthcare industry through personalized services, tailored content, improved availability and accessibility, and cost-effective delivery. Despite these exciting advancements in the transition from clinic-centric to patient-centric healthcare, many challenges still need to be tackled. The key to successfully unlock and enable this horizon shift is adopting hierarchical and collaborative architectures to provide a high level of quality in key attributes such as latency, availability, and real-time analytics. In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-driven IoT eHealth architecture based on the concept of Collaborative Machine Learning approach in which the intelligence is distributed across Device layer, Edge/Fog layer, and Cloud layer. This solution enables healthcare professionals to continuously monitor health-related data of subjects anywhere at any time and provide real-time actionable insights which ultimately improves the decision-making power. The feasibility of such architecture is investigated using a comprehensive ECG-based arrhythmia detection case study. This illustrative example discusses and addresses all important aspects of the proposed architecture from design implications such as corresponding overheads, energy consumption, latency, and performance, to mapping and deploying advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network) to such architecture.\n",

Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing.

            "                  In recent years, flexible hydrogel strain sensors have shown potential applications in artificial intelligence, such as medical monitoring, human motion detection, and intelligent robotics. It is a challenge for flexible strain sensors with stretchable and efficient healing to ensure stable sensing under repeated deformations or damage. In this study, a highly stretchable, self-healing, and strain-sensitive hydrogel was prepared from acrylic acid (AA), graphene oxide (GO), iron ions (Fe3+), and ammonium persulfate (APS) via one-step in-situ polymerization without a chemical crosslinker. The polyacrylic acid (PAA)-GO hydrogel showed dual crosslinking effect: (i) ionic coordination bonding between Fe3+ ions and the carboxylic functional groups of PAA and GO and (ii) hydrogen bonding between the polar functional groups of PAA and the oxygen-containing functional groups of PAA and GO. Because of dynamic double-crosslinked networks, the hydrogel exhibited superior stretchability (1185.53% elongation at break) and self-healing property (88.64% healing efficiency) as well as electrical self-healing performance. Moreover, strain-sensitive conductive hydrogels can be used as flexible sensors to monitor body motions (e.g., bending of fingers, wrists, and elbows) by detecting change in electrical signal and can be used as wearable sensors and for personal health monitoring.\n",

            "                  An increasing volume of prostate biopsies and a worldwide shortage of urological pathologists puts a strain on pathology departments. Additionally, the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability in grading can result in overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer. To alleviate these problems, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system with clinically acceptable accuracy for prostate cancer detection, localisation, and Gleason grading.\n",

            "                  We digitised 6682 slides from needle core biopsies from 976 randomly selected participants aged 50–69 in the Swedish prospective and population-based STHLM3 diagnostic study done between May 28, 2012, and Dec 30, 2014 (ISRCTN84445406), and another 271 from 93 men from outside the study. The resulting images were used to train deep neural networks for assessment of prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test dataset comprising 1631 biopsies from 246 men from STHLM3 and an external validation dataset of 330 biopsies from 73 men. We also evaluated grading performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological pathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We assessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics and tumour extent predictions by correlating predicted cancer length against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the concordance between grades assigned by the AI system and the expert urological pathologists using Cohen's kappa.\n",

            "                  The AI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0·997 (95% CI 0·994–0·999) for distinguishing between benign (n=910) and malignant (n=721) biopsy cores on the independent test dataset and 0·986 (0·972–0·996) on the external validation dataset (benign n=108, malignant n=222). The correlation between cancer length predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting pathologist was 0·96 (95% CI 0·95–0·97) for the independent test dataset and 0·87 (0·84–0·90) for the external validation dataset. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved a mean pairwise kappa of 0·62, which was within the range of the corresponding values for the expert pathologists (0·60–0·73).\n",

            "                  An AI system can be trained to detect and grade cancer in prostate needle biopsy samples at a ranking comparable to that of international experts in prostate pathology. Clinical application could reduce pathology workload by reducing the assessment of benign biopsies and by automating the task of measuring cancer length in positive biopsy cores. An AI system with expert-level grading performance might contribute a second opinion, aid in standardising grading, and provide pathology expertise in parts of the world where it does not exist.\n",

            "                  Recent applications of artificial intelligence have shown great promise for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical care. Numerous clinical decision support tools exist in today's electronic health records (EHRs) such as medication dosing support, order facilitators (eg, procedure specific order sets), and point of care alerts. However, less has been done to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled risk predictors into EHRs despite wide availability of validated risk prediction tools. An interoperability standard known as SMART on FHIR (substitutable medical applications and reusable technologies on fast health interoperability resources) offers a promising path forward, enabling digital innovations to be seamlessly integrated with the EHR with regard to the user interface and patient data. For the next step in progress towards the goal of learning healthcare and informatics-enabled spine surgery, we propose the application of SMART on FHIR to integrate existing and new risk predictions tools in spine surgery through an EHR add-on-application.\n",

            "                  Artificial intelligence (AI) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to transform every aspect of society. Preparing for a “good AI society” has become a hot topic, with growing public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society to enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks associated with its use. However, despite the renewed interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which AI scholarship is moving and whether the field is evolving towards the goal of building a “good AI society”. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and conceptual structure of AI research. It provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how AI research can help understand the social changes brought about by AI and prepare for a “good AI society.” The research agenda is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector management, security, and justice.\n",

            "                  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and mobile Internet, the new requirements for human-computer interaction have been put forward. The personalized emotional interaction service is a new trend in the human-computer interaction field. As a basis of emotional interaction, emotion recognition has also introduced many new advances with the development of artificial intelligence. The current research on emotion recognition mostly focuses on single-modal recognition such as expression recognition, speech recognition, limb recognition, and physiological signal recognition. However, the lack of the single-modal emotional information and vulnerability to various external factors lead to lower accuracy of emotion recognition. Therefore, multimodal information fusion for data-driven emotion recognition has been attracting the attention of researchers in the affective computing filed. This paper reviews the development background and hot spots of the data-driven multimodal emotion information fusion. Considering the real-time mental health monitoring system, the current development of multimodal emotion data sets, the multimodal features extraction, including the EEG, speech, expression, text features, and multimodal fusion strategies and recognition methods are discussed and summarized in detail. The main objective of this work is to present a clear explanation of the scientific problems and future research directions in the multimodal information fusion for data-driven emotion recognition field.\n",

With the growing number of studies reporting findings from this field and the critical need for public health and policy decisions to be based on the strongest science possible, transparency and clarity in reporting in spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies is essential. A task force supported by the International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE) identified a need for guidance in this area and developed a Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology Reporting Standards (ISLE-ReSt) Statement. The aim is to provide a checklist of recommendations to improve and make more consistent reporting of spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies. The STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement for cohort studies was identified as an appropriate starting point to provide initial items to consider for inclusion. Reporting standards for spatial data and methods were then integrated to form a single comprehensive checklist of reporting recommendations. The strength of our approach has been our international and multidisciplinary team of content experts and contributors who represent a wide range of relevant scientific conventions, and our adherence to international norms for the development of reporting guidelines. As spatial, location-based, and artificial intelligence technologies used in spatial lifecourse epidemiology continue to evolve at a rapid pace, it will be necessary to revisit and adapt the ISLE-ReSt at least every 2–3 years from its release.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Diabetes Mellitus is commonly known as diabetes. It is one of the most chronic diseases as the World Health Organization (WHO) report shows that the number of diabetes patients has risen from 108 million to 422 million in 2014. Early diagnosis of diabetes is important because it can cause different diseases that include kidney failure, stroke, blindness, heart attacks, and lower limb amputation. Different diabetes diagnosis models are found in literature, but there is still a need to perform a survey to analyze which model is best. This paper performs a literature review for diabetes diagnosis approaches using Artificial Intelligence (neural networks, machine learning, deep learning, hybrid methods, and/or stacked-integrated use of different machine learning algorithms). More than thirty-five papers have been shortlisted that focus on diabetes diagnosis approaches. Different datasets are available online for the diagnosis of diabetes. Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) is the most commonly used for diabetes prediction. In contrast with other datasets, it has key factors which play an important role in diabetes diagnosis. This survey also throws light on the weaknesses of the existing approaches that make them less appropriate for a diabetes diagnosis. In artificial intelligence techniques, deep learning is widespread and in medical research, heart rate is getting more attention. Deep learning combined with other algorithms can give better results in diabetes diagnosis and heart rate should be used for other cardiac disease diagnoses.\n",

            "                  Given that artificial intelligence and machine learning is now a reality of modern existence, rapidly being applied to medicine, and especially radiology, we submit a new educational perspective. By codifying technology education during the diagnostic radiology internship, we believe it is not only possible but necessary, to reframe the identity of diagnostic radiology. This paper describes the restructuring of the radiology clinical internship, limiting clinical rotations to high-yield essentials, thereby allowing for the introduction of data and technology science, and comprehensive medical physics training. By linking modality-immersion based training with the physics of each technology, we postulate a more thorough understanding and, ultimately, the mastery of current and future technological innovations. Concurrently we advocate for the study of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to understand how radiologists can apply this technology to help patients on the precision and population health levels. This training would allow interns to spend the majority of their time under the umbrella of a radiology department, in lieu of multiple rotations on an assortment of clinical services. An in-depth technology and physics exam at the end of the internship would be a natural transition to the start of the R1 year, allowing for the application of this newly attained knowledge throughout their residency. Diagnostic radiologists have led medicine into the digital era, and now we should lead the medical community into this transformational era as the “Data-Driven Physician” of the 21st century.\n",

            "                  Diabetic retinopathy is the common eye disease due to blood vessel damage in the human retina that happens as a result of diabetes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides an important role in improving the well- being of human in many areas, especially in health sector. The objective of the proposed work is to diagnose the Diabetic Retinopathy at early stage from the public repository of retinal images by applyingmachine learning algorithms. Herewe consider retinal images for analysing and detecting diabetic retinopathy disease, by constructing supervised models such as the classifiers from representations by Decision Trees, Decision Rules and Instance based learners. The java implementation available in the tool WEKA is exploited and implemented to get highest accuracy 70.1516% and Weighted Average ROC values 0.862.\n",

            "                  Mental health has become a severe problem that significantly influences people’s living quality. With the rapid development of science and technology, a completely new direction for mental health improving by using the interaction between robots and people has emerged. As an intelligent personal agent, a robot can be easily accepted in people’s daily life, meeting users’ behavior and mental demands to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the existing robot design is very limited, and a household personal robot is too large to be carried anywhere . The usage of wearable devices is simple, but these devices cannot offer diversified services. Therefore, this paper puts forward an emotion-aware system that integrates a personal robot, smart clothing, and cloud terminal. A new ’people-centered’ emotion-interaction mode is realized. Namely, personal robot and smart clothing supplement each other seamlessly and interact jointly with users . Artificial intelligence technology and knowledge graph are used to design emotion perception and interaction algorithms including intelligent recommendation, relation recognition, emotional expression recognition. Also, different scenarios are analyzed . Finally, a testbed is built to carry out relevant tests to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and emotion-aware system. According to the obtained test results, the system can be widely used to serve people and improve people’s mental health.\n",

            "                  We here discuss human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening avenues to achieve elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem in high-income country (HIC) settings, covering both the most recent data on the performance of HPV testing, as well as the currently most robust triage methods that are known. We also provide an outlook to several other promising, yet not fully established, options for triage that have been proposed, including methylation, dual staining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Finally, we discuss the key issue of how to adapt screening in the presence of programmatic HPV vaccination, and how this combination can best be leveraged for comprehensive cancer control. We conclude that, for the HIC setting, evidence-based and effective cervical screening methods are readily available, but whichever method or platform is chosen, we would propose that recurring audits of performance and population attendance remain common denominators for maintaining successful disease prevention.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  Flexible wearable pressure sensors have attracted tremendous interest for applications in human health monitoring, electronic skin, artificial intelligence and so on. However, it is still a critical challenge for pressure sensors to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and wide sensing range while performing well in response time, stability, reliability and wearing comfortability. Here, conductive MXene/cotton fabric was fabricated using the simple dip-coating technique and then sandwiched between polydimethylsiloxane film and an interdigitated electrode for flexible wearable piezoresistive pressure sensor. The abundant hydroxyl groups of cotton fabric and functional groups of MXene were beneficial for the good adhesion of conductive MXene nanosheets onto the entangled fiber networks, constructing effective conductive network. Taking advantage of the excellent flexibility and three-dimensional porous structure of cotton fabric and the special sandwich architecture of the sensor, the MXene/cotton fabric (MCF) based pressure sensor exhibited high sensitivity (5.30 kPa−1 in the pressure range of 0–1.30 kPa), broad sensing range (0–160 kPa), rapid response/recovery time (50 ms/20 ms), excellent stability and long-term durability. Moreover, the MCF based pressure sensor can be employed to detect and distinguish various human health signals, including finger motion, early stage Parkinson’s static tremor and wrist pulse. Importantly, E-skin was also designed based on the MCF based pressure sensor for the recognition of different tactile stimuli, exhibiting promising potential in next generation wearable electronics.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  \n",
            "                  The condition of a high-voltage circuit breaker (HVCB) may have a major effect on a power system. In the practical application of artificial intelligence, many advanced technologies have been applied to the assessment of the state of health of a HVCB or the identification of a fault. To date, most related research related to the improvement of a feature extraction process or a classification method intended to attain a higher level of precision have been based on a single sensor. However, any method that relies on data from a single sensor cannot exceed a given level of precision. Most studies have neglected to consider whether the information provided by a single vibration signal is sufficient and effective. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-vibration Information joint diagnosis method to improve the diagnosis of HVCB faults. The procedure has two key steps: 1) the basic probability assigns an acquisition using a classification and regression tree (CART); and 2) a combination rule design based on the Gini index in the CART. By comparing the results of eight typical classifiers and three traditional fusion methods in a case of HVCB system, the validity and superiority of the proposed method has been verified.\n",

            "                  Structural steel connections are highly susceptible to damage due to long-term effect such as missing or loosening of bolts along with corrosion, fatigue, accidental loads etc. throughout their service life. The existing local connection damage identification methods require expensive instrumentation and the sensors at a specific location. That is why, artificial intelligence (AI) has become very popular and has come up with better alternatives, efficiency which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional vibration-based connection damage identification techniques. As per the current literature, most of the AI-based techniques that use experimentally generated damage data suffer the paucity of appropriate and quality dataset corresponding to different damage conditions. Hence the authors have proposed a model-based scheme for evaluating the health condition of steel structural connection in such cases, which uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of the response signal. The method requires only global vibration signals from impulse excitation on the structure and subsequently the updated finite element (FE) model of steel structure considering connection flexibility can be utilized for multiple functionalities. For experimental validation of the proposed methodology, a two-story structural steel frame has been considered. The performance of the proposed methodology is further verified and validated through the identification of beam-column connection damage additionally introduced in the test frame.\n",

            "                  As other sectors advance through the aid of cognitive computing, whereas the health care sector is still evolving, offering more advantages for all consumers. The growing complexities of healthcare are compounded by an aging population that contributes to underprivileged decision-making contributing to adverse impacts on the standard of treatment and raises the cost of treatment. Advances in this field, however, is hampered by numerous challenges that create a gap between the knowledge base and user queries, query inconsistencies, and user domain information set. In recent years, the rapid development with the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for medical applications has already been shown, from diagnostic heart failure to 1-D cardiovascular beatings and automated finding using multi-dimensional clinical data. Consequently, smart decision support structures are required, which can enable clinicians to make more informed treatment decisions. An innovative solution is to harness increasing healthcare digitization that produces enormous volumes of clinical data contained in e-HCR and merge it with advanced ML software to improve clinical decision-making, thus extending the medication evidence base at the same time. Through this work, we are investigating new methodologies as well as digging at specific real-life technologies already being implemented in the medical sector and concentrating mainly on studying about accurate depictions of patients from e-HCR.\n",

Pour autant, sous couvert de cette complexité, éviter de poser cette question conduit également à un écueil majeur. En effet, les nouvelles générations ont grandi avec ces technologies, et l’arrivée de ces générations dans les structures de soins impose de prendre en compte les réponses à apporter aux mutations induites par le numérique. En psychiatrie, cette question fait son apparition, notamment au travers des activités d’art-thérapie, ce d’autant plus que l’art a vu l’émergence au cours de ces dernières années d’un art numérique.

Health and mental health have not escaped the arrival of new technologies and has seen many new devices of care, using connected objects, applications, or artificial intelligence. However, addressing the digital issue is a delicate subject as it is clear that this field is wide and constantly evolving. However, the new possibilities offered by digital are an incredible opportunity to modernize the therapeutic setting. Moreover, the arrival of the new generation which have grown with these digital technologies requires to consider the responses to be made to the changes induced by digital technology. One of the domains which has been used by psychiatric to care their patient for years was the art therapy. This field is interested in expression and creation as a possible source of recovery. And the question of digital technology in art therapy is all the more important than numeric has already been integrated in art through the concept of numeric art. Despite this observation it could be difficult to envisage therapeutic setting modification to incorporate digital field in art-therapy as it is also important to take account of pathological aspects. To address this issue, we propose to develop in this article the current knowledge about digital application in mental health. In this part we develop three paragraphs about the applications in psychiatry, the serious games and the virtual reality, and the devices online such as massive open online courses and social networks. We then propose to present the current status of numeric art with a presentation of the history of numeric art and some examples of this construct. And then we propose to discuss of the possible mutation in art therapy in touch with digitals mutations. This discussion implies to address the question of the therapeutic setting in art therapy and the general question of changes induces by digital in our thinking and habits. This discussion also proposes to develop concrete possibilities to set up these technologies in art therapy.\n",

            "                  In recent days, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Deep learning, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are considered to be an emerging technologies to solve variety of real world problems. These techniques are importantly applied in various fields such as healthcare systems, transportation systems, agriculture and smart cities to produce fruitful results for number of issues in today's environment. This research work focuses on one such application in the field of IoT together with cloud computing. More number of sensors that are deployed in human body is used to collect patient related data such as deviation in body temperature and others which leads to variation in blood cells that turned to be cancerous cells. Main intention of this work is design a cancer prediction system using Internet of Things upon extracting the details of blood results to test whether it is normal or abnormal. In addition to this, encryption is done on the blood results of cancer affected patient and store it in cloud for quick reference through Internet for the doctor or healthcare nurse to handle the patient data secretly. This research work concentrates on enhancing the health care computations and processing. It provides a framework to enhance the performance of the existing health care industry across the globe. As the entire medical data has to be saved in cloud, the traditional medical treatment limitations can be overcome. Encryption and decryption is done using AES algorithm in order to provide authentication and security in handling cancer patients. The main focus is to handle healthcare data effectively for the patient when they are away from the home town since the needed cancer treatment details are stored in cloud. The task completion time is greatly reduce from 400 to 160  by using VMs. CloudSim gives an adaptable simulation structure that empowers displaying and reproduced results.\n",

            "                  Recently, the whole world became infected by the newly discovered coronavirus (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2, or widely known as COVID-19, has proved to be a hazardous virus severely affecting the health of people. It causes respiratory illness, especially in people who already suffer from other diseases. Limited availability of test kits as well as symptoms similar to other diseases such as pneumonia has made this disease deadly, claiming the lives of millions of people. Artificial intelligence models are found to be very successful in the diagnosis of various diseases in the biomedical field In this paper, an integrated stacked deep convolution network InstaCovNet-19 is proposed. The proposed model makes use of various pre-trained models such as ResNet101, Xception, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and NASNet to compensate for a relatively small amount of training data. The proposed model detects COVID-19 and pneumonia by identifying the abnormalities caused by such diseases in Chest X-ray images of the person infected. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.08% on 3 class (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal) classification while achieving an accuracy of 99.53% on 2 class (COVID, NON-COVID) classification. The proposed model achieves an average recall, F1 score, and precision of 99%, 99%, and 99%, respectively on ternary classification, while achieving a 100% precision and a recall of 99% on the binary class., while achieving a 100% precision and a recall of 99% on the COVID class. InstaCovNet-19’s ability to detect COVID-19 without any human intervention at an economical cost with high accuracy can benefit humankind greatly in this age of Quarantine.\n",

            "doi_doc.description:  Sexual cyberbullying is becoming a serious problem in today's society. In the workplace, this issue is more complex because of the power imbalance between potential perpetrators and victims. Preventing sexual cyberbullying in organizations is very important for a safety and respectful workplace. Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) standards establish certain policies to be considered to create an organizational culture based on zero tolerance to sexual cyberbullying. The research aims to broaden knowledge about personality and sexual cyberbullying. Therefore, this paper proposes a crucial tool to explore potential sexual cyberbullying behaviour. This study analysed how personality traits, particularly those related to the Dark Triad (psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism), might influence this behaviour. Participants (N = 374) were Spanish young adults, using the convenience sampling to recruit them. The methodology focused on the use of structural equation modelling and ensemble classification tree. First, we tested the proposed hypotheses with structural equation method based on covariance using the Lavaan R-package. Second, for the ensemble of classification trees, we applied the package randomForest and Adabag (bagging and boosting) in R. Results proposed high levels of psychopathy and Machiavellianism are more likely to be related to sexual cyberbullying behaviours. Organizations could use the tool proposed in this research to develop internal policies and procedures for detection and deterrence of potential cyberbullying behaviours. By raising awareness about cyberbullying behaviour including its conceptualisation and measurement in training courses, organizations might build an organizational culture based on a respectful workplace without sexual cyberbullying behaviours.\n",

            "                  The aim of this study was to discuss the status of and perspective for biomarker validation in view of the challenges imposed on national healthcare systems due to an increasing number of citizens with chronic diseases and new expensive drugs with effects that are sometimes poorly documented. The demand for a paradigm shift toward stratification of patients or even ‘personalized medicine’ (PM) is rising, and the implementation of such novel strategies has the potential to increase patient outcomes and cost efficiency of treatments. The implementation of PM depends on relevant and reliable biomarkers correlated to disease states, prognosis, or effect of treatment. Beyond biomarkers of disease, personalized prevention strategies (such as individualized nutrition guidance) are likely to depend on novel biomarkers.\n",

            "                  Biomarkers vary greatly in complexity, from single genomic mutations to metagenomic analyses of the composition of the gut microbiota and comprehensive analyses of metabolites, metabolomics. Using biomarkers for decision-making has previously often relied on measurements of single biomolecules. The current development now moves toward the use of multiple biomarkers requiring the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence. Still, the usefulness of biomarkers is often challenged by suboptimal validation, and the discovery of new biomarkers moves much faster than standardization efforts. To reap the potential benefits of personalization of treatment and prevention, healthcare systems and regulatory authorities need to focus on validation and standardization of biomarkers.\n",

Innumerable studies have advocated the control of geomorphologic, geologic, hydrogeologic, biogeochemical, and anthropogenic factors on arsenic mobilization, flow, and distribution patterns within the Ganges River delta. We have developed transboundary regional-scale models for computing the probability of groundwater As concentrations to exceed the WHO permissible thresholds for drinking water of 10\\xa0μg/L within the Ganges River delta as a function of the various geomorphologic-(hydro)geologic-hydrostratigraphic-anthropogenic controlling factors, using statistical methods and artificial intelligence (AI) [i.e., machine learning] techniques namely, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms, followed by probabilistic delineation the high As-hazard zones within the delta. A “hybrid multi-modeling approach” was adapted for this study, which involved the introduction of hydrostratigraphic parameters (aquifer connectivity and surficial aquitard thickness) derived from a high-resolution transboundary hydrostratigraphic model developed for the Ganges River delta aquifer system, as predictors for modeling groundwater As probabilities within the delta.\\n                  The RF model outperforms the BRT and LR model in terms of model performance. Model outputs suggest the dominant influence of surficial aquitard thickness and groundwater-fed irrigated area (%) on groundwater As. While, the north-central and southern regions of the Ganges River delta show low As-hazard (<10\\xa0μg/L), the western and north-eastern regions demonstrate elevated hazard level (>10\\xa0μg/L). An estimated 30.3 million people are found to be exposed to elevated groundwater As within the study area. Thus, our study demonstrates that such hybrid, predictive models are not only helpful in delineating the regional-scale distribution of groundwater As-hazard zones in the areas with limited As data but is also useful in identifying the possible exogenous forcing that may have led to the worst, natural pollution in human history.\\n               ',\n",
